    "Welcome to Macroeconomics. Along with the theory lectures, you will be guided through the process of making simulation codes in the Python programing language. This note is intended to make sure that all students can use the notebook environment that I will provide. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains several easy problems below. Follow the instructions in the problems and write solution codes if necessary, download the edited notebook to your own computer and <span style=\"color:red\">**submit it to me by email or via BEEF**</span>. \n",

    "Jupyter notebook is a web-browser based application, in which you can write both text and codes. You can insert images too. Although Jupyter notebook can run any programing languages (if you install the corresponding kernel), we will stick to the Python programing language. \n",

    "![code](./assets/img/code.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you change it to “Markdown\", you can write text such as that you are reading right now. Markdown cells can contain plain text, HTML codes, pictures and mathematical expressions ($\\int f(x) dx$)  etc.\n",

    "## Problem 1\n",
    "\n",
    "The below code is an example of variable definition and elementary calculation. Because it's not run yet, it doesn't have output. Please run it by making the cell active (by clicking) and press **SHIFT + ENTER**. If you see “Out[*]:\", you are done."
